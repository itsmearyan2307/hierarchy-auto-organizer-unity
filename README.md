### ðŸ§© Grouping Options

You can configure grouping behavior via the **Environment Grouping Options** section:

- **Group By**:  
  - `Name`: Groups by base name (e.g. `Tree_01`, `Tree_02` â†’ `Tree`)
  - `Tag`: Groups objects by tag (e.g. all `P rops` in one folder)

- **Exclude Tags**: Add tags like `Player`, `Interactable` to prevent them from being grouped.

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

- Use `Generate Empty Marker` to create labeled separator objects in the hierarchy.
- Always commit your scene before using bulk auto-organization for safety.
- This tool is designed to be **non-destructive** and uses **Undo** for all actions.
